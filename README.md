## Basic info

Many online contests make gathering votes a part of their process for choosing winners. The problem is that a lot of them are designed with flaws...

So in this project and for educational purposes only we are going to make some simple scripts to parse data from a website and post information to vote in a fake contest. Using the Python library "requests" and "pytesseract".
